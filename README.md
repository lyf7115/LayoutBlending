# Hierarchical Layout Blending with Recursive Optimal Correspondence
Qt implementation for our paper "Hierarchical Layout Blending with Recursive Optimal Correspondence"
(ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2022).

We present a novel method for blending hierarchical layouts with semantic labels. The core of our method is a hierarchical structure correspondence
algorithm, which recursively finds optimal substructure correspondences, achieving a globally optimal correspondence between a pair of hierarchical
layouts. This correspondence is consistent with the structures of both layouts, allowing us to define the union of the layoutsâ€™ structures. The resulting
compound structure helps extract intermediate layout structures, from which blended layouts can be generated via an optimization approach.
The correspondence also defines a similarity measure between layouts in a hierarchically structured view. Our method provides a new way for novel
layout creation. The introduced structural similarity measure regularizes the layouts in a hyperspace. We demonstrate two applications in this paper, i.e.,
exploratory design of novel layouts and sketch-based layout retrieval, and test them on a magazine layout dataset. The effectiveness and feasibility of
these two applications are confirmed by the user feedback and the extensive results.
